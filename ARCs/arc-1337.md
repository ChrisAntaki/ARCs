## Abstract

A specification to describe a mechanism to enforce [Royalty Payments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalty_payment) to a set of Recipients given a policy describing the royalty shares.

## Motivation

This ARC is defined to provide a consistent set of asset configurations and ABI methods that, together, enable a royalty payment or payments to be the appropriate parties.

The parties due some royalty may be a list of addresses of 1 or more members with different rates.

An example may include some music rights where the label, the artist, and any investors have some assigned royalty percentage that should be enforced on transfer. During the sale transaction, the appropriate royalty payments should be included or the transaction must be rejected.

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


[Royalty Policy](#royalty-policy) - The data structure that defines how royalties are dispersed

[Royalty Enforcer](#royalty-enforcer) - The contract that enforces the royalty payments given the Royalty Policy and performs transfers of the assets.

[Asset Subject to Royalties](#royalty-asset) - The asset that is subject to royalty payments on transfer

### Royalty Policy 

A Royalty Share consists of an `address` that should receive a Royalty payment and a `share` representing some share of the total payment amount. The Royalty Share MUST be specified in terms of [basis points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point) of the payment amount.

A Royalty Policy is specified as a list of a list of addresses and associated Royalty weighting. Additionally, if any assets besides Algos are acceptable, 


```ts

type RoyaltyShare {
    address: string, // The address that should receive this share of the payment
    share: number // The share of the payment due, specified in basis points
}

type RoyaltyPolicy {
    shares: RoyaltyShare[], // All the shares defined for this policy
    allowed_assets: number[] // The list of asset ids that are acceptable for payment
}

```

### Royalty Enforcer

The Royalty Enforcer is an application that controls the transfer of ASAs subject to the Royalty Policy. 

This is accomplished by exposing an interface defined as a set of [ABI Methods](#abi-methods) allowing a grouped transaction call 

### Royalty Asset 

The Royalty Asset is an ASA subject to royalty collection and MUST be created with the the appropriate roles and parameters. 

> Because the protocol does not allow updating a role after it's been deleted, if the creator thinks she may want to modify them later, they must be set to some non-zero address.


#### Asset Roles

The Clawback role MUST be set to the Application Address.

> Since the Royalty Enforcer relies on using the Clawback mechanism to perform the transfer the Clawback should NEVER be set to the zero address. 

The Freeze role MAY be set to zero OR the Application Address. 

> If the creator wants to allow an ASA to be Royalty Free after some conditions are met, it should be set to the Application Address 

The Manager role MAY be set to zero OR the Application Address.

> If the creator wants to update the Freeze role, this should be set to the application address

The Reserve role may be set to anything.

#### Asset Parameters

The DefaultFrozen address MAY be set to true or false.

> In the case that a creator wants the asset to no longer be subject to royalty collection, this should be set to false.



### ABI Methods


*Required*


SetPolicy
    
    set_policy(royalty_asset: asset, royalty_shares: Tuple(address, uint64)[], allowed_assets: asset[])

Sets the Royalty Policy for a given asset. 

The `asset` is the ASA id of the asset the policy is set for.

The `royalty_shares` are encoded as an array of `tuple(address, uint64)` that represents the Royalty Recipient and Royalty Share in basis points. The address of a Royalty Recipient SHOULD NOT be repeated, only the last occurrence of the address will be used for their Royalty Share. 

> The maximum number of Royalty Recipients is limited to the number of foreign accounts that may be passed from a grouped set of application call transactions.  As of go-algorand v3.4.0 this number is:
> 4 [max accts per call] * (16 [max calls per group] - 1 [transaction reserved for payment]) = 60

The `allowed_assets` list contains the ASA ids that are acceptable for payment. The contract logic MUST opt into the set of assets specified in order to accept the payments as part of a transfer.

> All the Royalty Recipients SHOULD be opted into the full set of assets contained in this list but MAY NOT be checked ahead of time. In the case that an account is not opted into an asset, any transfers where payment is specified for that asset will fail until the account opts into the asset.


Transfer: 

    transfer(royalty_asset: uint64, from: address, to: address, payment: transaction, extra_app_calls: ApplicationCallTransaction[])

Transfers the Asset after checking that the royalty policy is adhered to.

The `royalty_asset` is the ASA ID to be transferred. It MUST have a policy defined prior to attempting a transfer.

The `from` parameter is the address for the account the ASA is transferred from.

The `to` parameter is the address for the account the ASA is transferred to.

The `payment` parameter is a reference to the transaction that is transferring some asset (ASA or Algos) from the buyer to the Application Address. 

The `extra_app_calls` parameter is an array of ApplicationCallTransactions containing any addresses that are part of the Royalty Policy beyond the first 4. 


> Some way to _check_ that this transfer is approved by the current owner needs to be considered. At the moment, if no approval consideration is made, a transfer may be initiated by some account for a 0 amount payment and since the transfer is performed by the application logic, the current owner may not have approved the transfer. This approval mechanism needs to be flexible enough to support any sale type (plain sale, auction, etc..).

*Optional*

Move 

    move(royalty_asset: uint64, new_address: address)

Moves an asset to the new address without enforcing any royalty payment. May be useful in the case of a marketplace where the NFT must be placed in some escrow account.

## Rationale

The motivation behind defining a royalty enforcement specification is the need to guarantee a portion of a payment is received by select addresses on sale of an asset. Current royalty implementations are either platform specific or are only adhered to when an honest seller complies with it, allowing for the exchange of an asset without necessarily paying the royalties.

The use of a smart contract as a clawback address is a guaranteed way to know an asset transfer is only ever made when certain conditions are met, or made in conjunction with additional transactions. To make things easier on the purchaser, the smart contract can also handle the calculations required in dividing up and dispensing the payments to the respective parties by using inner transactions.

On Ethereum the EIP-2981 standard allows for ERC-721 and ERC-1155 interfaces to signal a royalty amount to be paid, however this is not enforced and requires marketplaces to implement and adhere to it.

## Backwards Compatibility

Existing ASAs with unset freeze and clawback roles will be incompatible with this specification.

## Test Cases

Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for ARCs that are affecting consensus changes.  If the test suite is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/arc-####/`.


## Reference Implementation


TODO: implement

An optional section that contains a reference/example implementation that people can use to assist in understanding or implementing this specification.  If the implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/arc-####/`.

## Security Considerations


All ARCs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. ARC submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An ARC cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.
