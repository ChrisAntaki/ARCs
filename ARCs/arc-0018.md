## Abstract

A specification to describe a mechanism to enforce [Royalty Payments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalty_payment) to a Royalty Collector given a policy describing the royalty shares, both on primary and secondary sales.

## Motivation

This ARC is defined to provide a consistent set of asset configurations and ABI methods that, together, enable a royalty payment to a Royalty Collector.

An example may include some music rights where the label, the artist, and any investors have some assigned royalty percentage that should be enforced on transfer. During the sale transaction, the appropriate royalty payments should be included or the transaction must be rejected.

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


[Royalty Policy](#royalty-policy) - The data structure that defines how royalties are dispersed

[Royalty Enforcer](#royalty-enforcer) - The contract that enforces the royalty payments given the Royalty Policy and performs transfers of the assets.

[Royalty Collector](#royalty-collector) - The account that collect the royalty and provides the royalty distribution logic. It could be set to a Single Signature, a Multi Signature, a Smart Signature or even another Smart Contract.

[Asset Subject to Royalties](#royalty-asset) - The asset that is subject to royalty payments on transfer

[Third Party Marketplace](#third-party-marketplace) - A third party marketplace may be any marketplace that implements the appropriate methods to initiate transfers.

### Royalty Policy 

A Royalty Share consists of an `address` that should receive a Royalty payment and a `share` representing some share of the total payment amount. The Royalty Share MUST be specified in terms of [basis points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point) of the payment amount.

A Royalty Policy is specified as a Royalty Collector and associated Royalty weighting. Additionally, if any assets besides Algos are acceptable, 


```ts
type RoyaltyPolicy {
    share:              number,  // The share of the payment due, specified in basis points
    royalty_collector:  string,  // The address that should collect this share of the payment
    allowed_assets:     number[] // The list of asset ids that are acceptable for payment
}
```

### Royalty Enforcer

The Royalty Enforcer is an application that controls the transfer of ASAs subject to the Royalty Policy. 

This is accomplished by exposing an interface defined as a set of [ABI Methods](#abi-methods) allowing a grouped transaction call.

### Royalty Collector

The Royalty Collector is a generic account that could be set to a Single Signature, a Multi Signature, a Smart Signature or even to another Smart Contract. The Royalty Collector is then responsible for the royalty distribution logic, making the Royalty Enforcement Specification more general and composable.


### Royalty Asset 

The Royalty Asset is an ASA subject to royalty collection and MUST be created with the the appropriate roles and parameters. 

> Because the protocol does not allow updating a role after it's been deleted, if the creator thinks she may want to modify them later, they must be set to some non-zero address.


#### Asset Roles

The Clawback role MUST be set to the Application Address.

> Since the Royalty Enforcer relies on using the Clawback mechanism to perform the transfer the Clawback should NEVER be set to the zero address. 

The Freeze role MUST be set to the Application Address if `FreezeAddr != ZeroAddress`, else set to `ZeroAddress`.

> If the creator wants to allow an ASA to be Royalty Free after some conditions are met, it should be set to the Application Address 

The Manager role MUST be set to the Application Address if `ManagerAddr != ZeroAddress`, else set to `ZeroAddress`.

> If the creator wants to update the Freeze role, this should be set to the application address

The Reserve role MAY be set to anything.

#### Asset Parameters

The `DefaultFrozen` MUST be set to true.


### Third Party Marketplace

In order to support secondary sales on external markets this spec was designed such that the Royalty Asset may be listed without transferring it from the current owners account.  A Marketplace may call the transfer request as long as the address initiating the transfer has been set as the `authorized_address` through the [offer](#offer) method in some previous transaction by the current owner.


### ABI Methods

#### Required


##### SetPolicy
    
    set_policy(royalty_asset: asset, royalty_receiver: address, royalty_share: uint64, allowed_asset_1: asset, allowed_asset_2: asset, allowed_asset_3: asset, allowed_asset_4: asset)

Sets the Royalty Policy for a given asset. 

The `royalty_asset` is the ASA id of the asset the policy is set for.  If the `royalty_asset` is 0, the policy is defined for _any_ asset that has its freeze and clawback set to the application address. 

The `royalty_receiver` is the address of the account that should receive a partial share of the payment or asset transfer for any [transfer](#transfer) of the `royalty_asset` 

The `royalty_share` is the share of the payment that should be sent to the `royalty_receiver`.  It is specified in basis points (e.g., 1% is 100).  

The `allowed_assets_n` arguments represents the ASA ids that are acceptable for payment. The contract logic MUST opt into the set of assets specified in order to accept the payments as part of a transfer.

> TODO: since assets cant be in dynamic arrays, this bit is annoying. We could define N selectors (up to 8 for assets) and dispatch them all to the same set of logic? for now just hardcoded to 4 and caller expected to pass 0s if they don't need all 4.  As of https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/pull/77, this limitation has been changed. Update spec accordingly once SDK support is available.

>The Royalty Collector SHOULD be opted into the full set of assets contained in this list but MAY NOT be checked ahead of time. In the case that an account is not opted into an asset, any transfers where payment is specified for that asset will fail until the account opts into the asset.


##### Transfer: 

    transfer(royalty_asset: asset, from: account, to: account, royalty_collector: account, royalty_asset_amount: uint64, payment: transaction)
    transfer(royalty_asset: asset, from: account, to: account, royalty_collector: account, royalty_asset_amount: uint64, payment: transaction, payment_asset: asset)

Transfers the Asset after checking that the royalty policy is adhered to. This call must be sent by the current owner (the `from` parameter)

The `royalty_asset` is the ASA ID to be transferred. It MUST have a policy defined prior to attempting a transfer.

The `from` parameter is the address for the account the ASA is transferred from.

The `to` parameter is the address for the account the ASA is transferred to.

The `royalty_receiver` parameter is the address for the account that collects the royalty and takes care of any redistribution logic (if any). 

The `royalty_asset_amount` parameter is the number of units of this ASA ID to transfer. The amount MUST be less than or equal to the amount `offered` by the `from` account.

The `payment` parameter is a reference to the transaction that is transferring some asset (ASA or Algos) from the buyer to the Application Address. 

The `payment_asset` parameter is used in the case that the payment is being made with some asset rather than with Algos. It MUST match the Asset ID of the AssetTransfer payment transaction. 

The transfer call SHOULD be part of a group with a size of 2 (app call + payment/asset transfer)

> While its possible to enforce the group size limit, it is possible to circumvent the royalty enforcement logic by simply making an Inner Transaction application call with the appropriate parameters and a small payment, then in the same outer group the "real" payment. The counter-party risk remains the same since the inner transaction is atomic with the outers. 
> Some ways to prevent a small royalty payment and larger payment in a later transaction of the same group might be by using an `allow` list that is checked against the `auth_addr` of the offer call. The `allow` list would be comprised of known and trusted marketplaces that do not attempt to circumvent the royalty policy. The `allow` list may be implicit as well by transferring a specific asset to the `auth_addr` as frozen and on `offer` a the balance must be > 0 to allow the `auth_addr` to be persisted.

Upon each transfer the the Royalty Enforcer SHOULD assert that `AuthAddr == AssetSender` for the Seller (`from` parameter) and `AuthAddr == AssetReceiver` for the Buyer (`to` parameter). In other words Seller and Buyer accounts not have been Rekeyed. Exceptions can be handled with `Move` method.

> The rational for this check is ensuring that `Rekeying` is not exploited to transfer the `royalty_asset` ownership circumventing the Royalty Policy. Two parties involved in the trade could create a Group Transactions in which: 1. Seller rekeys the `from` to the Buyer `to`, 2. Buyer sends payment to `other_seller_account`. Note that nothing can prevent the users to execute such trade but the Royalty Enforcer tries to dissuade this behavior: if such trade happens, the Receiver will no longer be able to re-sell the Royalty ASA in the regular way.



#### Offer:

    offer(royalty_asset: asset, royalty_asset_amount: uint64, authorized_address: account)

Flags the asset as transferrable and sets the address that may initiate the transfer request.

The `royalty_asset` is the ASA ID that is offered. It MUST have a policy defined prior to attempting to offer

The `royalty_asset_amount` is the number of units of the ASA ID that are offered. The account making this call MUST have at least this amount. 

The `authorized_address` is the address that may initiate the transfer. This address may be any valid address in the Algorand network including and Application Account's address.

If any transfer is initiated by an address that is _not_ listed as the `authorized_address` for this asset ID from this account, the transfer is rejected.


#### Rescind:

    rescind(royalty_asset: asset)

Removes the asset from being offered by the sender.

The `royalty_asset` is the ASA ID that is being rescinded.

#### Optional

#### Create NFT

    create_nft()uint64

Creates an NFT with the appropriate parameters set. 

Returns the Asset ID that was just created

##### Move 

    move(royalty_asset: asset, royalty_asset_amount: uint64, to: account)

Moves an asset to the new address without enforcing any royalty payment. May be useful in the case of a marketplace where the NFT must be placed in some escrow account. Any logic may be used to validate this is an authorized transfer.

The `royalty_asset` is the asset being transferred without applying the Royalty Enforcement logic.

The `royalty_asset_amount` is the number of units of this ASA ID that should be moved.

The `to` parameter is the intended receiver of the asset. This account MUST be opted into the asset prior to calling this method or it will fail at the protocol level.


### Storage

#### Global Storage

For Policies, each policy is stored in a Global State field, keyed by the 8 byte string representing the uint64 Asset id. 

A Special value of 0x0000000000000000 may be used as a key for the default policy. 

When determining which policy may apply to the Royalty Asset
    - First check for a key present that matches the Royalty Asset Id 
    - Then use the default policy if set
    - If neither are present, the transaction MUST fail

#### Local Storage

For an offered Asset, The authorizing address and amount offered should be stored in a Local State field keyed by the 8 byte string representing the uint64 asset id of the asset being offered.

### Metadata

The metadata associated to an asset MAY conform to [ARC-3](./arc-0003.md) or [ARC-69](./arc-0069.md) with an additional field in the `attributes` section specifying the Application ID for the Royalty Enforcer Contract. 

```js
//...
"attributes":{
    "arc18":{
        "application-id":123,
    }
    //...
}
//...
```

## Rationale

The motivation behind defining a Royalty Enforcement specification is the need to guarantee a portion of a payment is received by select royalty collector on sale of an asset. Current royalty implementations are either platform specific or are only adhered to when an honest seller complies with it, allowing for the exchange of an asset without necessarily paying the royalties.

The use of a smart contract as a clawback address is a guaranteed way to know an asset transfer is only ever made when certain conditions are met, or made in conjunction with additional transactions. The Royalty Enforcer is responsible for the calculations required in dividing up and dispensing the payments to the respective parties. The present specification does not impose any restriction on the Royalty Collector distribution logic (if any), which could be achieved through a Multi Signature account, a Smart Signature or even through another Smart Contract.

On Ethereum the EIP-2981 standard allows for ERC-721 and ERC-1155 interfaces to signal a royalty amount to be paid, however this is not enforced and requires marketplaces to implement and adhere to it.

## Backwards Compatibility

Existing ASAs with unset freeze and clawback roles will be incompatible with this specification.

## Reference Implementation

https://github.com/algorand-devrel/royalty

## Security Considerations

Rekeying an account can be seen as circumventing this logic since there is no counter-party risk given that a rekey can be grouped with a payment. We address this by making sure the auth address on the buyer and seller are both set to the zero address.

Because we use the clawback mechanism to move the asset, we need to be sure that the current owner is actually interested in making the sale. We address this by requiring the `offer` method is called to set an authorized address OR that the AssetSender is the one making the application call.
